Consider a medical image from your medical image dataset selected. Implement different edge detection techniques such as:
	a. Sobel (Vary dx, vary dy, vary both and observe the output)
	b. Prewitt
	c. Laplacian
	d. Canny Edge Detector (Vary for 3 sets of threshold values).
Compare the results and conclude which edge detection technique is good for your input medical image.
