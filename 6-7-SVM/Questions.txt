1. Demonstrate simple linear SVM classification using a medical domain related dataset. [The dataset may also be numerical. This is given for you to just understand basic SVM]

1. Use a medical image dataset. Apply SVM and perform a Binary classification over the dataset. Guage the performance of your SVM classification. 

2. Use any face expression dataset. Demonstrate Multiclass classification using SVM. Guage the performance of your SVM classification.
